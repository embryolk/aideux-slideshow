                    We’ve taken the utmost care in creating sizes to flatter and fit different women. Please use our guide when selecting your size. If you are between sizes, we recommend choosing the larger of the two sizes, as taking a garment in is easier than letting it out.  Please email us with any questions or concerns. We are happy to assist.
